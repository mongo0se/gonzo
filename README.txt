GONZO Script v1.0
======================

CONFIGURATION

Edit "connect.php". Your MySQL details are required, so the script can
setup its database and tables it is going to work from.

Edit "gonzo.css" for styling.

For simpler styling, drop any JPEG, GIF and PNG into the "header_imgs"
directory. These are cycled through at random.

INSTALLATION

Extract files to WWW directory.

Configure MySQL by running "install.php".







END.
